# libxkbcommon

libxkbcommon is a keymap compiler and support library which processes a
reduced subset of keymaps as defined by the XKB specification.

## Quick Guide

See [Quick Guide](doc/quick-guide.md).

## API

While libxkbcommon's API is somewhat derived from the classic XKB API as found
in X11/extensions/XKB.h and friends, it has been substantially reworked to
expose fewer internal details to clients.

See the [API Documentation](http://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/modules.html).

## Dataset

libxkbcommon does not distribute a keymap dataset itself, other than for
testing purposes.  The most common dataset is xkeyboard-config, which is used
by all current distributions for their X11 XKB data.  More information on
xkeyboard-config is available here:
    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig

## Relation to X11

See [Compatibility](doc/compat.md) notes.
